# ExtraLeaderboardPositions

Trackmania Next (2020) plugin that allows you to see the times of more key positions (1st, 10th, 100th, 1000th and 10000th place times)

This can be used to see how far you are from getting a better trophy reward in a TOTD for example.

I plan to add more features, like more customization.

Please open an issue if you see any trouble.
