# ExtraLeaderboardPositions

Trackmania Next (2020) plugin that allows you to see the times of more key positions (1st, 10th, 100th, 1000th and 10000th place times)

This can be used to see how far approximatly you are from getting a better trophy reward in a TOTD for example.

If you have any ideas for features, i'd be happy to hear them ! (you can use the issues or discord, in the OpenPlanet server)

Please open an issue if you see any trouble.
